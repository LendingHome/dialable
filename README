Phone numbers are not a big deal if you can validate the input at the time you've got a human right there.  My enterprise tends not to have that ability, as we receive large files from clients with little or no validation done.  Rather than abandon #s which don't validate, I wrote this to parse and normalize a string into a standard NANP phone number, possibly including an extension.

require "dialable"
pn = Dialable::NANP.parse("+1(800)555-1212 ext 1234")

>> puts pn.to_s         // Pretty output
800-555-1212 x1234

>> puts pn.to_digits    // Address book friendly
8005551212 x1234

>> puts pn.to_dialable  // PBX friendly
8005551212

>> puts pn.extension
1234
